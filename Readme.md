## **_About the tutorial_**

In this 'DIGITAL DESIGN ON  VIRTUAL FPGA' conducted by [VLSI System Design]( https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/).
 - We have learned about what is FPGA & its advantages over ASICS.
 - A introduction on Makerchip Platform & the Virtual FPGA Boards available at the Makerchip website.
 - Introduction to LEDs and seven-segment & Interfacfing LEDS & seven segment displays.
 - Introduction to Finite State Machines theory
 - Verilog Finite State Machine implementation of traffic light controller design.

## **_Introduction to Virtual FPGA_**

 - Field-Programmable Gate Array(FPGA) is a hardware circuit that a user can program to carry out logical operations.
 - FPGAs are beneficial for prototyping application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) or processors
 - The advantage of FPGA beproject Virtual FPGA Lab aims to solve the problem by taking advantage of the VIZ Visualization feature in the Makerchip platform and providing visualisations of FPGA’s basic peripherals, thereby mimicking the physical lab experienceing energy-efficient, flexible to reprogram, support parallelism, decreased latency made them widely used in many applications.
 - FPGA’s are a bit costly and difficult to learn for beginners. Also, students don’t have access to physical FPGA Lab classes in their curriculum amidst this pandemic situation.

## **_Makerchip Platform_**
 - Makerchip is a free web-based IDE as well as available as makerchip-app, a virtual desktop application for developing high-quality integrated circuits.
 - a virtual desktop application for developing high-quality integrated circuits. we can code, compile, simulate, and debug Verilog designs, with help of our browser. Your code, block diagrams, and waveforms are tightly integrated.
 - Makerchip supports the emerging Transaction-Level Verilog standard.
 - Transaction-Level Verilog, or TL-Verilog, represents a huge step forward by eliminating the need for the legacy language features of Verilog and by introducing simpler syntax.
 - At the same time, TL-Verilog adds powerful constructs for pipelines and transactions.
 - Visual Debug,Organized Waveforms,Organized Diagrams are some of the advantages in TL-verilog.
 
 ## **_Virtual FPGA Boards_**
 - The Below mentioned FPGA Boards are available in the makerchip platform for virtual simulation. 
 - 1. Zedboard Zynq-7000 ARM/FPGA SoC Development Board.
 - 2. EDGE Artix 7 FPGA Development Board.
 - 3. Basys 3 Artix-7 FPGA Trainer Board.
 - 4. Icebreaker FPGA.
 - 5. Nexys A7.

  - NMOS Construction  
    - MOSFET has four terminals G= GATE D= DRAIN S=SOURCE B=BODY
    - Gate oxide is made up of SiO2 layer that acts as insolation.
    - Metal gate is place over the gate oxide layer 
    - it has a P-type Substrate
