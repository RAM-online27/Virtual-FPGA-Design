In this 'DIGITAL DESIGN ON  VIRTUAL FPGA' conducted by [VLSI System Design]( https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/).
 - We have learned oabout what is FPGA & its advantages over ASICS.
 - Field-Programmable Gate Array(FPGA) is a hardware circuit that a user can program to carry out logical operations.
 - FPGAs are beneficial for prototyping application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) or processors
 - The advantage of FPGA being energy-efficient, flexible to reprogram, support parallelism, decreased latency made them widely used in many applications.
 - A introduction on Makerchip Platform & the Virtual FPGA Boards available at the Makerchip website.
 - Introduction to LEDs and seven-segment & Interfacfing LEDS & seven segment displays.
 - Introduction to Finite State Machines theory
 - Verilog Finite State Machine implementation of traffic light controller design.

  - NMOS Construction  
    - MOSFET has four terminals G= GATE D= DRAIN S=SOURCE B=BODY
    - Gate oxide is made up of SiO2 layer that acts as insolation.
    - Metal gate is place over the gate oxide layer 
    - it has a P-type Substrate
